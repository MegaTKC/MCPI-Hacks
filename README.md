# MCPI Hacks
by Nitro

## Requirements
- Minecraft-PI / Minecraft-Pi-Reborn
- Python 3.6

## Usage
Download this repo from git clone or from zip. If downloaded repo from zip you must extract it. Now open the repo and run python <filename>.py. These hacks are in real clients such as WURST and Sigma. 
  
### Known Issues and Bugs
Hacks such as scaffold are invisible to players, so users / mobs can walk through your client-side blocks. When in the sky with scaffold players will see you walking on invisible blocks or just floating in the air. You can run this in survival mode and creative mode in MCPI.
